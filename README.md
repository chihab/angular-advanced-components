# Advanced Components Patterns

Code shows how it is possible to move an Angular component from completely static to very configurable (state and view) using inputs, content projection and template references.
- Basic inputs and ouptuts between parent and child components
- Write compound components using content projection
- Share parent component state using dependency injection
- React's Render Prop pattern using template references
No advanced skills required, you'd need to know the basics of creating Angular components and directives, use inputs and outputs.

Inspired by Isaac Mann blog posts and Kent. C Dodds Advanced React components patterns.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
